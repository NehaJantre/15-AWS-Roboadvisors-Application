# FinTech-Module-15-Challenge - Roboadvisors

## Application:
In this Challenge, you’ll combine your new AWS skills with your existing Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

You’ll be asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

* Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

* Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

* Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot
